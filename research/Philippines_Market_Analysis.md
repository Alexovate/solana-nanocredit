## Sari-Sari Store Networks & Distribution Channels

### Major Tech-Enabled Networks

| Platform | Store Coverage | Key Features | API/Integration |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|

| **MySuki** | 300,000+ stores | Modular B2B/app, bank partnerships | ⭐ App-based, not public API |

### Strategic Recommendation
**Primary Target**: Peddlr (most developer-friendly, rural focus aligns with underserved markets)  
**Secondary Target**: Growsari (established loan infrastructure via SariPay)

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### Major Players

| Competitor | Model | Scale | Interest Rates | Key Weakness |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Fuse Lending** | GCash-integrated | $2.7B+ disbursed, 5.4M users | Variable (GScore-based) | Centralized, no portable credit |
| **JuanHand** | Mobile app | 2.5M+ borrowers, $50-1,000 loans | High (AI risk scoring) | High CAC, no merchant network |
| **Venio** | Nano-loans app | ~50K users (stalled) | 15% convenience fee | Failed to scale, distribution bottleneck |
| **Government/NGOs** | Various programs | Fragmented | Subsidized | Slow, bureaucratic |

### Competitive Advantages of NanoCredit

|---------|---------------------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Blockchain Transparency** | ✅ On-chain | ❌ Centralized | ❌ Centralized | ❌ Centralized |

## Lessons from Competitors

### Venio: The Cautionary Tale
**Model**: Nano-loans ($1-5) with 15% convenience fee, app-based scoring
**Peak**: ~50,000 users
**Failure Points**:
- ❌ **High CAC**: No distribution partnerships, pure app-based acquisition
- ❌ **Tiny margins**: 15% fee barely covered operational costs
- ❌ **No ecosystem**: Isolated app with no integration to existing platforms

**Key Lesson**: Distribution partnerships are critical for nano-lending success

### Fuse Lending: The Success Story
**Model**: Range of digital loans (nano to larger) built into GCash app
**Scale**: $2.7B+ disbursed, 5.4M users
**Success Factors**:
- ✅ **Zero CAC**: Embedded in GCash (81M users)
- ✅ **Rich data**: GScore leverages transaction history
- ✅ **Trust**: Backed by GCash brand
- ✅ **Seamless UX**: One-tap loan approval

**Key Lesson**: Platform integration and data-driven underwriting enable massive scale

## Technical Integration Plan

### Identity Verification Stack
```
User Registration Flow:
1. Download NanoCredit app (or access via Peddlr integration)
2. Connect Solana wallet (Phantom/Solflare)
3. Optional: Civic Pass verification
   - Level 1 (CAPTCHA): $5 credit limit, free, 30 seconds
   - Level 2 (Phone SMS): $10 credit limit, $0.50, 2 minutes
   - Level 3 (Full KYC): $25 credit limit, $2.00, 5 minutes
4. Visit sari-sari store for first loan (proximity verification)
```

### Payment Integration
```
Loan Disbursement:
Merchant Wallet (USDC) → Customer Wallet (USDC) → GCash (PHP)
[On-chain transfer] → [Off-ramp via GCrypto] → [Spend at store]

Loan Repayment:
Customer earns PHP → GCash cash-in → GCrypto (PHP→USDC) → Smart Contract
[Fiat income] → [Digital wallet] → [On-ramp] → [On-chain repayment]
```

### Smart Contract Localization
```solidity
struct PhilippinesMarketConfig {
    string countryCode = "PH";
    uint256 minLoanAmount = 2_000_000;  // $2 USDC (6 decimals)
    uint256 maxLoanAmount = 25_000_000; // $25 USDC
    uint256 interestRateBps = 5000;     // 50% APR
    address[] acceptedTokens = [USDC_SOLANA];
    bool civicPassRequired = false;     // Optional for higher limits
    uint256 repaymentPeriodDays = 30;
}
```

## Regulatory & Compliance Considerations

### Current Regulatory Environment
✅ **Digital Lending**: Regulated by SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)  
✅ **Stablecoins**: USDC legal for peer-to-peer transactions  
✅ **KYC/AML**: Required for financial services (Civic Pass compliant)  
✅ **Data Privacy**: Covered by Data Privacy Act of 2012

### Compliance Strategy
1. **Partner with licensed entities**: Peddlr/Growsari handle merchant onboarding
2. **Civic Pass for KYC**: Outsource identity verification to compliant provider
3. **Transparent operations**: On-chain audit trail for regulatory review
4. **Local legal counsel**: Engage Philippine fintech lawyers for ongoing compliance

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Primary Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
